# UART-Communication-in-ATMEGA328P
The repository contains the simulation files for **UART(Universal Asynchronous Reciever-Transmitter) Communication in ATMEGA328P** which is the primary microcontroller used in Arduino UNO.</br>
You will be required an **Arduino IDE** and **Proteus PCB Designing and Cicuit Building Software** to run the simulation on your PC.</br>
Steps to run the simulation are as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Compile the code for both the Arduinos 1 and 2 in the Arduino IDE by turning on the compilation options.</li>
  <li>Open the <b>UART_Communication.pdsprj</b> file in Proteus for simulation.</li>
  <li>Double the Arduino connected to the potentiometer and upload the <b>.hex</b> file of <b>Arduino1.ino</b> to it.</li>
  <li>Doble click the Arduino connected to the LED and upload the <b>.hex</b> file of <b>Arduino2.ino</b> to it.</li>
  <li>Now click on run simulation to run the simulation.</li>
  <li>You can adjust the brightness of the LED by changing the potentiometer readings.</li>
</ol>
